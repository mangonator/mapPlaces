# mapPlaces - My Google Maps JS API CRUD application demo

<h2>A little info about the project:</h2> 

<p>This application was created as a demo for a job position.</p>
<p>At first I was going to make this using Angular 5, but when I began working on this I though that a basic jQuery / Bootstrap 4 / PHP application would be enough.</p>
<p>It would also work better with the Google API.</p>

<p>In hindsight I could / should have used Angular, but this is the road I took so I went with it.</p>
<p>Overall I'm fairly satisfied with my end result, allthough I could improve this more hours and hours.</p>
<p>I did not complete all the given tasks, but the basic crud capabilities are there and it looks nice so I'm happy.</p>
<br>
<p>If you want to run this app in your own evinronment, localhost, test server etc. you'll need to create your own database with fields:</p>
<p>id, title, description, address, lat, lng, openinghour, closinghour</p>
<p>You'll also need to change the parameters in config.php to match your own environment.</p>
<p>Make sure you are using PHP 5.5 or later, this project was made on 7.1</p>
